Hi there, welcome to my website.

This site serves as a blog where I write about my work and other stuff that interest me. I am a PhD student working on many applications of deep learining. My main focus is on meta learning. I am fascinated by many fields of computer science and beyond, including machine learning (duh!), quantum computing, information theory, statistics, psychology, politics and history.

The main driver behind my work is the ambition to find the simplest explanations for things that appear to be magic when left unstudied.
