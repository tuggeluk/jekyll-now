### Abstract
We present the DeepScores dataset with the goal of ad-
vancing the state-of-the-art in small objects recognition,
and by placing the question of object recognition in the
context of scene understanding. DeepScores contains high

quality images of musical scores, partitioned into 300 0 000
sheets of written music that contain symbols of different
shapes and sizes. With close to a hundred millions of small
objects, this makes our dataset not only unique, but also the
largest public dataset. DeepScores comes with ground truth
for object classification, detection and semantic segmenta-
tion. DeepScores thus poses a relevant challenge for com-
puter vision in general, beyond the scope of optical music
recognition (OMR) research. We present a detailed statis-
tical analysis of the dataset, comparing it with other com-
puter vision datasets like Caltech101/256, PASCAL VOC,
SUN, SVHN, ImageNet, MS-COCO, smaller computer vi-
sion datasets, as well as with other OMR datasets. Finally,
we provide baseline performances for object classification
and give pointers to future research based on this dataset.
