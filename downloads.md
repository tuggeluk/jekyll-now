## Downloads
Downloads for all the avialable DeepScores ressources. Please report any bugs or problems with the download to [tugg@zhaw.ch](mailto:tugg@zhaw.ch).

### DeepScores
The original DeepScores features fixed-shape symbols only. Usually you dont need all the archives.   [DeepScores](https://repository.cloudlab.zhaw.ch/artifactory/deepscores/archives/2017/)

### DeepScores Dense
DeepScores-dense is a subset of the whole DeepScores dataset containing only about 2000 pages but retaining the same amout of rare symbols as the full archive.

### DeepScores Extended
There is an updated version of DeepScores containing annotations for a larger number of symbols. Additionally there is information about the onset of symbols as well as the relative position of noteheads. For DeepScores extended only the dense version is avialable.
